# Plates

Experiment with designing and 3D printing flat plates
This has 8 rectangular objects with increasing number
of layers. First one has 1 and the last one has 8 layers.

This was with:

- Print Settings "All-layers-0.05mm-infil_100pct-spd_10mmps" and
- Filament Settings "Prusa PLA-em_3.0-less-cooling"

the first 4 layers printed fine but on the fifth layer there started
to be some curl on the edges and by the 7 and 8 layers shit happened.

Wirtten in python using the [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) framework.
